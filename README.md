# ChatBot

A simple chat assistant built with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) and a [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- An OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Create a `.env` file in the project root containing your OpenAI key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
   ```

## Running

Start the Gradio app with:

```bash
python main.py
```

A local URL will be shown in the terminal. Open it in your browser to chat with the bot.
